# New-food-recommender:
People need to eat, and there's so much variety in the available options! The problem is people don't always know what they like or don't like until they try it. The point of this New-food-recommender is to hopefully help people find new foods they like

## The Data
I'll be using various cooking and recipe sites to get data about various foods

## The Plan
I'll be building a database of recipe ingredients and cooking styles through webscraping, then I'll build a recommendation system based on the user's current food preferences.

## The Preperation
(I have not yet done any data cleaning or other preperation tasks. Stay tuned!)

## The Modeling
I plan on using ALS recommendations based on user item's similarity to other items

## The Results
(We'll find out soon. Stay tuned!)
